# to-do
This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/todo-list).

# Thoughts... :thinking:
This definitely got complex.. but glad I finally completed it. I had to figoure out event delegation, and working with composition over inheritance. At some point I need to come back and refactor it. I noticed some redudancy that could be reworked, and implemented some methods later in the project that I could use in other places.
