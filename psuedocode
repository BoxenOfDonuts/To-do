[to-do item properties]
title
description
due date
priority
notes?
checklist?

[to-do class]
contain all the items
broken into projects
should be able to make and delete projects


[gui]
kinda like this: https://en.todoist.com/

break down by today, scheduled

also projects + 
should have a + project
project view should have a 'preview' # of items in it
subtasks should be more tasks?

or like onenote

[process]
click add to-do
should open a prompt to enter the 'to do', description, due date (if any) and a priority
once complete you should be able to submit or cancel ( or click outside the box )

so it needs to 
1. draw the popup for the to-do, and make that object on submit
2. draw the popup for the project and add on submit




basic page should be there, no projects or taks though (should be js)


click add-project
should open a prompt to add a project title


[where do i put these topics]
try and use composition??
